<p>\textit{Consider the following two-person p-Beauty Contest game. Both players simultaneously choose a number between 0 and 100. Both players have their own target value: p1 and p2, respectively. The player whose number is closest to pi times the average of the two numbers wins a fixed price (e.g., 10 Eurocent). Suppose p1 = 0.7 and p2 = 1.5.}
\bigskip</p>

<p>\begin{itemize}
    \item[] \textit{a) Call the numbers that the players choose x1 and x2, respectively. Write down the inequality that needs to hold for player 1 to win the price}\</p>

<p>\textbf{Answer:}
$$\abs{x_1 - 0.7 \frac{(x_1 + x_2)}  {2}) } &lt;\abs{  x_2 - 1.5 \frac{(x_1+ x_2 )}{2} }$$
\bigskip</p>

<p>The left hand side of the inequality is the difference between the number that player 1 chooses and p1 times the average of the two numbers. The right hand side of the inequality is the same but for player 2.$\dots$
    \item[]\textit{b) Suppose that player 1 is a level-1 player (who thinks that player 2 is level-0). What number would player 1 choose?}\</p>

<p>\textbf{Answer:}\</p>

<p>\begin{align<em>} 
0.7 \frac{(50 + x_1)}{2} &amp;= x_1 \ 
\frac{(35 + 0.7x_1)}{2} &amp;= x_1\
35 + 0.7x_1 &amp;= 2x_1\
35 &amp;= 1.3x_1\
x_1 &amp;= \frac{35}{1.3}\
x_1&amp;\approx26.92\
\ceil[\big]{x_1}&amp;=27.00
\end{align</em>}
    \item[]\textit{c) Suppose that player 2 is a level-1 player (who thinks that player 1 is level-0). What number would player 2 choose?}\</p>

<p>\textbf{Answer:}\</p>

<p>\begin{align<em>} 
1.5 \frac{(50 + x_2)}{2} &amp;= x_2\
\frac{(75 + 1.5x_2)}{2} &amp;= x_2\
75 + 1.5x_2 &amp;= 2x_2\
75 &amp;= 0.5x_2\
x_2 &amp;= \frac{75}{0.5}\
x_2 &amp;= 150
\end{align</em>}</p>

<p>However, since the maximum number he can choose, we will choose 100 in all probability.\</p>

<pre><code>\item[]\textit{d) Suppose that player 1 is a level-2 player (who thinks that player 2 is level-1). What number would player 1 choose?}\\
</code></pre>

<p>\textbf{Answer:}\    </p>

<p>If player 1 is a level-2 player, he will think that player 2 is level-1 player. This means that he expects that player 2 thinks player 1 is a level-0 player. So he expects player 2 to play 100.\</p>

<pre><code>\begin{align*} 
</code></pre>

<p>0.7 \frac{(100+ x1)}{2} &amp;= x_1\
\frac{(70 + 0.7x1)}{2} &amp;= x_1\
70 + 0.7x_1 &amp;= 2x_1\
70 &amp;= 1.3x_1\
x_1 &amp;= \frac{70}{1.3}\
x_1&amp;\approx53.85 \
\ceil[\big]{x_1}&amp;=54.00
\end{align*}</p>

<p>therefore the player will choose 54\</p>

<pre><code>\item[]\textit{e) Suppose that player 2 is a level-2 player (who thinks that player 1 is level-1). What number would player 2 choose?}\\
</code></pre>

<p>\textbf{Answer:}\</p>

<p>If player 2 is a level-2 player, he will think that player 1 is level-1 player. This means that he expects that player 1 thinks player 2 is a level-0 player. So he expects player 1 to play 27.\</p>

<p>\begin{align<em>} 
 1.5 \frac{(27 + x_2)}{2} &amp;=x_2\
  \frac{(40.5 + 1.5x_2)}{2} &amp;= x_2\
 40.5 + 1.5x_2 &amp;= 2x_2\
40.5 &amp;= 0.5x_2\
x_2 &amp;= \frac{40.5}{0.5}\
x_2&amp;=81 \
\end{align</em>}
    \item[]\textit{f) Suppose that player 1 is a level $C_2$ believing that player 2 is a mixture of level-0 and level-1 with $ \tau = 2$. What number would player 1 choose?}\</p>

<p>\textbf{Answer:}\</p>

<p>For this question, we will use the Cognitive Hierarchy model. The distribution of levels is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution, meaning that:\</p>

<p>\begin{align<em>} 
f(k) &amp;= \frac{e^{-t} t^k}{k!}\
 Prob (level-k) &amp;=f(k)\
Prob (level-0) &amp;= \frac{e^{-2}2^0}{0!}\approx0.135\
Prob(level-1)&amp;= \frac{e^{-2}2^1}{1!}\approx0.271\
Prob(level-2)&amp;= \frac{e^{-2}2^2}{2!}\approx0.271\
\end{align</em>}</p>

<p>If player 1 is a level C-1 player, he expects that player 2 is a level-0 player. This means that he thinks that player 2 will choose 50 with probability 1. In this case, player 1 will choose 27 (see question (b)).\</p>

<p>If player 1 is a level C-2 player, he expects that player 2 is a level-0 player with probability 0.33\
\begin{equation}
 \frac{0.135}{0.135 + 0.271}\approx 0.33
\end{equation}</p>

<p>and a level-1 player with probability 0.67\
\begin{equation}
\frac{0.271 }{0.135 + 0.271}\approx 0.67
\end{equation}</p>

<p>So he thinks that player 2 will play, from $(1) $ and $(2)$:
$$(0.33 50) + (0.67 100)\approx83.5$$</p>

<p>Therefore player 2 will choose 84.</p>

<p>Therefore player 1 will choose:\
\begin{align<em>}
0.7 \frac{(84 + x_1)}{2} &amp;= x_1\
\frac{(58.8 + 0.7x_1)}{2} &amp;= x_1\
58.8 + 0.7x_1 &amp;= 2x_1\
58.8 &amp;= 1.3x_1\
x_1 &amp;= \frac{58.8}{1.3}\
x_1&amp;\approx45.23\
\ceil[\big]{x_1}&amp;=45
\end{align</em>}</p>

<p>Therefore player 1 will choose 45.\</p>

<p>If player 2 is a level C-1 player, he expects that player 1 is a level-0 player. This means that he thinks that player 1 will choose 50 with probability 1. In this case, player 1 will choose 100 (see question (c)).\</p>

<p>If player 2 is a level C-2 player, he expects that player 1 is a level-0 player with probability 0.33
\begin{equation}
 \frac{0.135}{(0.135 + 0.271)}\approx0.33
\end{equation}</p>

<p>and a level-1 player with probability 0.67\
\begin{equation}
 \frac{0.271}{0.135+0.271}\approx 0.67
\end{equation}</p>

<p>So he thinks that player 2 will play, from $(3) $ and $(4)$:</p>

<p>$$(0.33 50) + (0.67  27) \approx 34.59$$\
Roughly, he will choose 35.\</p>

<p>Therefore player 2 will choose:\
\begin{align<em>}
1.5 \frac{(35 + x_2)}{2} &amp;= x_2\
 \frac{52.5 + 1.5x_2}{2}&amp;= x_2\
 52.5 + 1.5x_2 &amp;= 2x_2\
52.5 &amp;= 0.5x_2\
x_2 &amp;= \frac{52.5}{0.5}\
x_2&amp;= 105\
\end{align</em>}</p>

<p>Therefore player 2 will choose 100 since that is the maximum.\
\item[]\textit{h) What is the Nash equilibrium for the game?}\</p>

<p>\textbf{Answer:}\</p>

<p>Solving the inequality in (a) (it means that $x_1 &gt;.042x_2$), we can say that for every number that player 1 chooses between 1 to 42, player 2 has a best response for it (up to 100). However, since player 2 cannot best respond to numbers higher than 42, if player 1 plays 43, every other number player 2 selects become trivial. So NE will be $b_1&gt;43$ and $b_2=$ any response.Then no player has an incentive to deviate.\</p>
