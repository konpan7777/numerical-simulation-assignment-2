Both players simultaneously choose a number between 0 and 100. Both players have their own target value: p1 and p2, respectively. The player whose number is closest to pi times the average of the two numbers wins a fixed price (e.g., 10 Eurocent). Suppose p1 = 0.7 and p2 = 1.5.}\r\n\\bigskip\r\n\r\n\r\n\\begin{itemize}\r\n    \\item[] \\textit{a) Call the numbers that the players choose x1 and x2, respectively.

However, since player 2 cannot best respond to numbers higher than 42, if player 1 plays 43, every other number player 2 selects become trivial. So NE will be $b_1>43$ and $b_2=$ any response.Then no player has an incentive to deviate.\\\\\r\n\r\n\r\n\\end{itemize}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n     \r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\\end{document}",
